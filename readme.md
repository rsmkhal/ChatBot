## What Tracery grammar does this make? What does it generate?

Magic 8 Ball Bot: The Tracery grammar generates various answers, including "Yes," "No," "Maybe," "Ask again later," and other similar responses.

Bad Advice Bot: The Tracery grammar creates bad advice based on the bot's current mood, including suggestions such as "Throw your computer out 
the window," "Treat yourself to a shopping spree," and other similar advice.

## Additional Info

Magic 8 Ball Bot: Play a sparkly/magic sound every time a response is given. It adds to the effect that the
bot is "magical".

Bad Advice Bot: Has multiple emotional "states" that it moves through (angry, happy, neutral) and represent that on the panel 
with a square that changes its color in accordance to its mood. Red = angry, Yellow = neutral, Green = happy.
