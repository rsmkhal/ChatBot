## What Tracery grammar does this make? What does it generate?

Magic 8 Ball Bot: The Tracery grammar generates various answers, including "Yes," "No," "Maybe," "Ask again later," and other similar responses.

Bad Advice Bot: The Tracery grammar creates bad advice based on the bot's current mood, including suggestions such as "Throw your computer out 
the window," "Treat yourself to a shopping spree," and other similar advice.

## Additional Info

Magic 8 Ball Bot: Play a sparkly/magic sound every time a response is given. It adds to the effect that the
bot is "magical".

Bad Advice Bot: Has multiple emotional "states" that it moves through (angry, happy, neutral) and represent that on the panel 
with a square that changes its color in accordance to its mood. Red = angry, Yellow = neutral, Green = happy.


## Gricean maxims

Magic 8 Ball Bot: The bot follows the maxims as it provides relevant and concise answers to the user's questions, maintaining 
clarity and being truthful to the extent of its capabilities.

Bad Advice Bot: The bot may not fully adhere to the Gricean maxims, as it intentionally provides bad advice, which contradicts
the maxim of quality (providing truthful information) and manner (being clear and concise).
