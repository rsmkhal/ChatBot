## What Tracery grammar did you make? What does it generate?

Magic 8 Ball Bot: The Tracery grammar generates various answers, including "Yes," "No," "Maybe," "Ask again later," and other similar responses.

Bad Advice Bot: The Tracery grammar creates bad advice based on the bot's current mood, including suggestions such as "Throw your computer out 
the window," "Treat yourself to a shopping spree," and other similar advice.

## What two complexifiers did you use? Describe how you used them, and what effect they have on your bot

Magic 8 Ball Bot: Play a sparkly/magic sound every time a response is given. It adds to the effect that the
bot is "magical".

Bad Advice Bot: Has multiple emotional "states" that it moves through (angry, happy, neutral) and represent that on the panel 
with a square that changes its color in accordance to its mood. Red = angry, Yellow = neutral, Green = happy.


## Look up the Gricean maxims. Do your bots obey them? Why or why not?

Magic 8 Ball Bot: The bot follows the maxims as it provides relevant and concise answers to the user's questions, maintaining 
clarity and being truthful to the extent of its capabilities.

Bad Advice Bot: The bot may not fully adhere to the Gricean maxims, as it intentionally provides bad advice, which contradicts
the maxim of quality (providing truthful information) and manner (being clear and concise).


## Which bot do you like more?

My personal preference is the Magic 8 Ball Bot due to its playful nature and "mysteriousness".

-----------
# Bot #1

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

Users can interact by asking the Magic 8 Ball any question. The bot will play a quick sound and respond with a semi-random answer.
Key words that are important are love, work, and health as those questions have specific responses.

## Describe your bot's character

The Magic 8 Ball Bot is mysterious and playful, providing enigmatic answers to user questions.


## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

The bot listens to user input, processes the question, and generates a random response based on its internal Tracery grammar.
Certain key words will trigger a response from the bot, but the rest are randomized.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

The background and color scheme of the pag are calm blue tones, because the bot is meant to relax/not be inherently
inflammatory. There is a wish count displayed on the screen and everytime a question is answered a magic 8 ball emoji
appears on the screen as a "list"/tally. Of course the emoji was selected because I wanted a direct visual of what
an 8 ball looks like.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

The bot can respond to the specific keyword 'love,' providing an unambiguously positive love-related answers to the user's queries.
The user cannot say anything in response except for another question for the bot to answer.


## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

Additionally, the bot can respond to questions about 'work,' giving work-related advice to work harder in response to the user's input.
Or, the bot can respond to anything containing 'health', where it suggests self-care.

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

Anything without a keyword of interest is randomized to ambiguous or general responses "yes", "no", "ask again later", etc.

-----------
# Bot #2

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

Users can engage with the Bad Advice Bot by asking for advice. The bot will respond with intentionally bad advice.
Keywords of interest are "love", "hate", "sad", "want", "happy", and "angry". 


## Describe your bot's character

The Bad Advice Bot has a mischievous and sarcastic personality, often providing intentionally unhelpful suggestions to users.

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

The bot listens to user input, identifies keywords to determine its mood, and then provides a response based on its current mood using the Tracery grammar.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I chose harsh yellow and orange colors because I dislike the colors and find them a bit aggravating. I then also have a square set up
in the panel that changes color depending on the mood of the bot. This is so that the user can perceive how the bot changes in response 
to their inputs.


## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

The bot can respond to general queries from the user with no specific key words, giving sarcastic or unhelpful advice
such as "Jump off a cliff" or "Eat a whole cake." The user can say anything they want in response, and depending on what key
words you use, the response will either be either aggressive or frivolous advice.


## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

The bot responds to keywords that indicate negative emotions, like "sad", "angry", or "hate", and changes its mood to "angry" and 
provides aggressive and unhelpful suggestions.


## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

The bot can also respond to keywords that suggest positive emotions, like "love", "want", and "happy", altering its mood to "happy" 
and giving playful and frivolous recommendations.
